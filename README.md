# Weather Dashboard

A simple, fast weather dashboard that shows real‑time weather, weekly forecast, air quality, sunrise/sunset, rainfall, and a comparison of multiple cities.  
I built the weather app using the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, with a single weather.js serverless function running on Vercel as the backend. I kept it simple the web app.

## 🔐 How the API works

I did **not** use Express or Node.js server.

Instead, it uses a **Vercel Serverless Function**, which is basically a single JavaScript file that Vercel runs on demand.
